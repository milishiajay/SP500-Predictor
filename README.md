Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict price movements of the S&P 500 stock market index.

Warning

I am not liable for any losses faced due to the following model, proceed with caution.

Key Steps:

Acquire historical price data using the yfinance package
Develop an initial model and evaluate baseline predictive performance
Construct a backtesting framework for robust out-of-sample accuracy assessment
Iteratively refine the model architecture and hyperparameters to optimize predictive accuracy.

Software Dependencies:

To replicate this work, the following software should be installed locally:

JupyterLab for notebook development
Python 3.8 or later
Package dependencies: pandas, yfinance, scikit-learn

Data Acquisition:

Historical stock price data for the S&P 500 will be downloaded programmatically using the yfinance library as model input.

Trading Techniques(Just for Information, proceed with caution)

You can use the above data to do call option rolling on S&P 500
