Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict price movements of the S&P 500 stock market index.

Key Steps:

Acquire historical price data using the yfinance package
Develop an initial model and evaluate baseline predictive performance
Construct a backtesting framework for robust out-of-sample accuracy assessment
Iteratively refine the model architecture and hyperparameters to optimize predictive accuracy.

Software Dependencies:

To replicate this work, the following software should be installed locally:

JupyterLab for notebook development
Python 3.8 or later
Package dependencies: pandas, yfinance, scikit-learn

Data Acquisition:

Historical stock price data for the S&P 500 will be downloaded programmatically using the yfinance library as model input.
